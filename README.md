### FKA Bnuoq Band Website

# Instructions

This is simply a frontend project for now.

Clone repo, npm install, npm start to run on your local machine.

# Goals

- Implement Shopify as my means of processing payments (Hydrogen seems cool, might as well learn something new).
- Incorporate sound clips and audio somewhere on the site. Some music teasers would be nice.
- Choose more consistent/appropriate color scheme.
- Add gifs of band members to corresponding panels (one member per panel).
